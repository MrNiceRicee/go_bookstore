This is my first attempt at making a GO backend. Pretty fun to use type language & be able to rapidly tab type.


## Lessons Learned

It was cool learning about how GO works
- Learned how to use Mux to create the server. 
- Interacting with the Databased with a typed language like GO
- GO's with error handling
- How to do validation in GO

Learned a lot from reading GO docs & the dependencies I used. Definitely a lot of trial and error
## Tech used
- MUX https://github.com/gorilla/mux
